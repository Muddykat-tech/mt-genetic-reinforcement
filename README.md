# mt-genetic-reinforcement
My Minor Thesis project investigating the viability of merging attributes of reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to combat poor generalization in reward sparse enviroments.

Test a model using scripts/environment/MarioEnvironment.py

Train a new model using scripts/ga/TrainMarioGA.py

The following projects were used to help me develop this codebase:

* https://github.com/robertjankowski/ga-openai-gym
